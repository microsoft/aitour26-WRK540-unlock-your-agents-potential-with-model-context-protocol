## Responsible AI

Microsoft is committed to helping our customers use our AI products responsibly, sharing our learnings, and building trust-based partnerships through tools like Transparency Notes and Impact Assessments. Many of these resources can be found at [https://aka.ms/RAI](https://aka.ms/RAI).
Microsoft‚Äôs approach to responsible AI is grounded in our‚ÄØAI principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

Large-scale natural language, image, and speech models - like the ones used in this sample - can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive, in turn causing harms. Please consult the [Azure OpenAI service Transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text) to be informed about risks and limitations.

The recommended approach to mitigating these risks is to include a safety system in your architecture that can detect and prevent harmful behavior. [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) provides an independent layer of protection, able to detect harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Azure AI Content Safety includes text and image APIs that allow you to detect material that is harmful. Within Azure AI Foundry portal, the Content Safety service allows you to view, explore and try out sample code for detecting harmful content across different modalities. The following [quickstart documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-text?tabs=visual-studio%2Clinux&pivots=programming-language-rest) guides you through making requests to the service.

Another aspect to take into account is the overall application performance. With multi-modal and multi-models applications, we consider performance to mean that the system performs as you and your users expect, including not generating harmful outputs. It's important to assess the performance of your overall application using [Performance and Quality and Risk and Safety evaluators](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in). You also have the ability to create and evaluate with [custom evaluators](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk#custom-evaluators).

You can evaluate your AI application in your development environment using the [Azure AI Evaluation SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html). Given either a test dataset or a target, your generative AI application generations are quantitatively measured with built-in evaluators or custom evaluators of your choice. To get started with the azure ai evaluation sdk to evaluate your system, you can follow the [quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/flow-evaluate-sdk). Once you execute an evaluation run, you can [visualize the results in Azure AI Foundry portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/evaluate-flow-results).

## Compiling the Python Requirements

1. Update the `requirements.in` file with libraries and specify version ranges.
2. Install pip tools `pip install pip-tools`.
3. Compile the requirements by running `pip-compile -r requirements.in -o requirements.lock.txt`.

## Published Docs

This repo is configured to use mkdocs, and the docs are in the `docs` folder.  The workshop docs are published [here](https://microsoft.github.io/aitour26-WRK540-unlock-your-agents-potential-with-model-context-protocol/).

Thanks for creating content for AI Tour 26.

One of our opportunities from FY25 was make a more consistent experience for attendees.  Following this template, and keeping users in these repos, will help us achieve this opportunity for this year's AI Tour.

Steps:

## Docs using MKDocs

If you are interested in using mkdocs, this repo is configured for it.

1. update the `mkdocs.yml` file to reference your session. Look particularly for the `site_name`, `site_author`, and `repo_name` tags.
1. Subfolders in the docs folder will show up as tabs in the navigation bar.

If you want to disable mkdocs:

1. Delete the mkdocs.yml file.
1. Delete the references to it in [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md)
1. Delete the docs/assets folder and its contents.

## MKDocs and Language Translation

1. From VS Code, select Agent mode, select the desired LLM, eg `claude sonnet 4`.
2. Type `/mkdocs-translations`
3. You'll be prompted to enter the target language, be sure to select the correct name of the language, e.g. `Spanish` or `French`.
4. The Agent will then translate the content in the `docs/docs/en` folder to the target language, creating a new folder under `docs/docs/` with the appropriate ISO 639-1 or locale code.

## Other folders

Note the data, docs, src, lab, session-delivery-resources folders.

1. Remove folders that you dont need.
1. Please keep and use the folders that you do need.  e.g. put your data in the data folder, and put your docs in the docs folder.

## Update Readme

1. Fill out the content below in this file, below the banner graphic.

## Update Repo Info

1. Note the data, docs, src, lab, session-delivery-resources folders.

    1. Remove folders that you dont need, but please keep and use the folders that you do need.  e.g. put your data in the data folder, and put your docs in the docs folder.

1. Fill out the content below in this file, below the banner graphic.

1. Update the Repo Info for this repo
    1. Click the gear icon‚öôÔ∏è in the upper right.
    1. Set a good description of this repo.
    1. Add the technologies that you're using in this session.  E.g. the same items that are in the Technologies Used section below.

1. Please embed links to Learn with your campaign codes!
