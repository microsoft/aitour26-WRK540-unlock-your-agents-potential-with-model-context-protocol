# Unlock Your Agent's Potential with Model Context Protocol and PostgreSQL

## A 50-minute interactive workshop

Imagine you’re a sales manager at Zava, a retail DIY company with stores across Washington State and a growing online presence. You specialize in outdoor equipment, home improvement tools, and DIY supplies.

You need to analyze sales data to find trends, understand customer preferences, and make informed business decisions. To help you, Zava has developed a conversational agent that can answer questions about your sales data.

## What you will learn in the workshop

Learn to build an AI agent that analyzes sales data, answers product questions, and helps customers find products using image search. Key topics:

1. **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**: Build and deploy AI agents with integrated tools and observability.  
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Connect LLMs to external tools, data, and systems for enhanced functionality.  
3. **Azure AI Foundry**: Rapidly build and deploy AI agents with integrated tools and observability.

### Just starting your AI Agents journey?

If you're new to AI agents, start with the [Build your code-first agent with Azure AI Foundry](https://aka.ms/aitour/WRK552){:target="_blank"} workshop. You'll learn to build a code-first agent using Azure AI Foundry, integrating LLMs with databases, documents, and Bing search — a solid foundation for more advanced agents like the Zava Agent.

## What is an LLM-Powered AI Agent?

A Large Language Model (LLM) powered AI Agent is semi-autonomous software designed to achieve a given goal without requiring predefined steps or processes. Rather than following explicitly programmed instructions, the agent determines how to accomplish a task using instructions and context.

For example, if a user asks, "**Show the total sales for each store as a pie chart**", the app doesn’t rely on predefined logic for this request. Instead, the LLM interprets the request, manages the conversation flow and context, and orchestrates the necessary actions to produce the store sales pie chart.

Unlike traditional applications, where developers define the logic and workflows to support business processes, AI Agents shift this responsibility to the LLM. In these systems, prompt engineering, clear instructions, and tool development are critical to ensuring the app performs as intended.

## Introduction to the Azure AI Foundry

[Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry/){:target="_blank"} is Microsoft’s secure, flexible platform for designing, customizing, and managing AI apps and agents. Everything—models, agents, tools, and observability—lives behind a single portal, SDK, and REST endpoint, so you can ship to cloud or edge with governance and cost controls in place from day one.
