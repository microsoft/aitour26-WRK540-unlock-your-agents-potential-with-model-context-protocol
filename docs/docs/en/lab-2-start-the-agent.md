## What You'll Learn

In this lab, you'll enable the Code Interpreter to analyze sales data and create charts using natural language.

## Introduction

In this lab, you will extend the Azure AI Agent with two tools:

- **Code Interpreter:** Lets the agent generate and run Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- **MCP Server tools:** Allow the agent to access external data sources using MCP Tools, in our case data in a PostgreSQL database.

## Lab Exercise

### Enable the Code Interpreter

In this lab, you'll enable the Code Interpreter to execute Python code generated by the LLM for analyzing Zava's retail sales data.

=== "Python"

    1. **Open** the `app.py`.
    2. Scroll down to around line 50 and find the line that adds the Code Interpreter and the MCP tools to the agent's toolset. These line are currently commented out with a `#` at the beginning.
    3. **Uncomment** the following lines:

          1. After the comment `Add code interpreter tool`, uncomment the 2 lines that adds the Code Interpreter tool to the agent's toolset.
          2. After the comment `Add MCP tool`, uncomment the rest if the code block, these lines add the MCP Server tools to the agent's toolset.

        ```python
        # Add code interpreter tool
        # code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool()
        # self.toolset.add(code_interpreter)

        # Add MCP tools
        # mcp_tools = McpTool(
        #     server_label="ZavaSalesAnalysisMcpServer",
        #     server_url=Config.DEV_TUNNEL_URL,
        #     allowed_tools=[
        #         "get_multiple_table_schemas",
        #         "execute_sales_query",
        #         "get_current_utc_date",
        #         "semantic_search_products",
        #     ],
        # )

        # mcp_tools.set_approval_mode("never")  # No human in the loop
        # self.toolset.add(mcp_tools)
        ```

    4. **Review** the code you uncommented. The code should look exactly like this:

        ```python

        After uncommenting, your code should look like this:

        ```python
        class AgentManager:
            """Manages Azure AI Agent lifecycle and dependencies."""

            async def _setup_agent_tools(self) -> None:
                """Setup MCP tools and code interpreter."""
                logger.info("Setting up Agent tools...")
                self.toolset = AsyncToolSet()

                # Add code interpreter tool
                code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool()
                self.toolset.add(code_interpreter)

                # Add MCP tools
                mcp_tools = McpTool(
                    server_label="ZavaSalesAnalysisMcpServer",
                    server_url=Config.DEV_TUNNEL_URL,
                    allowed_tools=[
                        "get_multiple_table_schemas",
                        "execute_sales_query",
                        "get_current_utc_date",
                        "semantic_search_products",
                    ],
                )

                mcp_tools.set_approval_mode("never")  # No human in the loop
                self.toolset.add(mcp_tools)
        ```

### Start a Conversation with the Agent

From the web chat client, you can start a conversation with the agent. The agent is designed to answer questions about Zava's sales data and generate visualizations using the Code Interpreter.

1. Product sales analysis. Copy and paste the following question into the chat:

    ```text
    Show the top 10 products by revenue by store for the last quarter
    ```

    After a moment, the agent will respond with a table showing the top 10 products by revenue for each store.

    !!! info
        The agent uses the LLM calls three MCP Server tools to fetch the data and display it in a table:

           1. **get_current_utc_date()**: Gets the current date and time so the agent can determine the last quarter relative to the current date.
           2. **get_multiple_table_schemas()**: Gets the schemas of the tables in the database required to by the LLM to generate valid SQL.
           3. **execute_sales_query**: Executes a SQL query to fetch the top 10 products by revenue for the last quarter from the PostgreSQL database.

2. Generate a pie chart. Copy and paste the following question into the chat:

    ```text
    Show sales by store as a pie chart for this financial year
    ```

    The agent will respond with a pie chart showing the sales distribution by store for the current financial year.

    !!! info
        This might feel like magic, so what’s happening behind the scenes to make it all work?

        Foundry Agent Service orchestrates the following steps:

        1. Like the previous question, the agent determines if it has the table schemas required for the query. If not, it uses **get_multiple_table_schemas()** tools to get the current date and the database schema.
        2. The agent then uses the **execute_sales_query** tool to fetch the sales
        3. Using the returned data, the LLM writes Python code to create a Pie Chart.
        4. Finally, the Code Interpreter executes the Python code to generate the chart.

3. Continue asking questions about Zava sales data to see the Code Interpreter in action. Here are a few follow-up questions you might like to try:

    - ```Determine which products or categories drive sales. Show as a Bar Chart.```
    - ```What would be the impact of a shock event (e.g., 20% sales drop in one region) on global sales distribution? Show as a Grouped Bar Chart.```
        - Follow up with ```What if the shock event was 50%?```
    - ```Which regions have sales above or below the average? Show as a Bar Chart with Deviation from Average.```
    - ```Which regions have discounts above or below the average? Show as a Bar Chart with Deviation from Average.```
    - ```Simulate future sales by region using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate confidence intervals. Show as a Line with Confidence Bands using vivid colors.```
