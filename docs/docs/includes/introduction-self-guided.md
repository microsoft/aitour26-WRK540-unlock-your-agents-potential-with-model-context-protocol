## Self-Guided Learners

These instructions are for self-guided learners who do not have access to a pre-configured lab environment. Follow these steps to set up your environment and begin the workshop.

## What you'll learn

In this section, you'll learn:

- About the workshop prerequisites and how to set up your environment.
- How to select your preferred programming language for the workshop.
- How to open the workshop in GitHub Codespaces or a local VS Code Dev Container.

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to teach you about the Azure AI Agents Service and the associated SDK. It consists of multiple labs, each highlighting a specific feature of the Azure AI Agents Service. The labs are meant to be completed in order, as each one builds on the knowledge and work from the previous lab.

## Prerequisites

1. Access to an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/){:target="_blank"} before you begin.
1. You need a GitHub account. If you don’t have one, create it at [GitHub](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"}.

## Select Workshop Programming Language

The workshop is available in both Python and C#. Use the language selector tabs to choose your preferred language. Note, don't switch languages mid-workshop.

**Select the tab for your preferred language:**

=== "Python"
    The default language for the workshop is set to **Python**.
=== "C#"
    The default language for the workshop is set to **C#**.

## Open the Workshop

The **preferred** way to run this workshop is using **GitHub Codespaces**. This option provides a pre-configured environment with all the tools and resources needed to complete the workshop. Alternatively, you can open the workshop locally using a Visual Studio Code Dev Container and Docker. Both options are described below.

!!! Note
    Building the Codespace or Dev Container will take several minutes. Start the process and then you can continue reading the instructions while it builds.

=== "GitHub Codespaces"

    Select **Open in GitHub Codespaces** to open the project in GitHub Codespaces.

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/aitour26-WRK540-unlock-your-agents-potential-with-model-context-protocol){:target="_blank"}



=== "VS Code Dev Container"

    <!-- !!! warning "Apple Silicon Users"
        The automated deployment script you’ll be running soon isn’t supported on Apple Silicon. Please run the deployment script from Codespaces or from macOS instead of the Dev Container. -->

    Alternatively, you can open the project locally using a Visual Studio Code Dev Container, which will open the project in your local VS Code development environment using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers){:target="_blank"}.

    1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
    2. Select **Dev Containers Open** to open the project in a VS Code Dev Container.
