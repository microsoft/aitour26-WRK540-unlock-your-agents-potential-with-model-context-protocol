# Summary

This workshop demonstrated how to leverage the Foundry Agent Service to create a robust conversational agent capable of answering sales-related questions, performing data analysis, generating visualizations, and integrating external data sources for enhanced insights. Here are the key takeaways:

## 1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Dynamic SQL Queries

- The agent uses the Foundry Agent Service to dynamically generate and execute SQL queries against a PostgreSQL database, enabling it to respond to user questions with accurate data retrieval. The MCP Server provides a structured way to manage the conversation context and ensure that the agent can handle complex queries effectively.

## 2. Context Management

- The agent efficiently manages conversation context using the Foundry Agent Service, ensuring interactions remain relevant and coherent.

## 3. Data Visualization

- With the Code Interpreter, the agent can generate visualizations such as pie charts and tables based on user queries, making data more accessible and actionable. You can attach additional fonts to the Code Interpreter to create visualizations that support multiple languages.

## 4. File Generation

- The agent can create downloadable files, including Excel, CSV, JSON, and image formats, providing users with flexible options to analyze and share data.

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

- The Foundry Agent Service includes built-in monitoring and logging capabilities, allowing you to track agent performance, user interactions, and system health. This is crucial for maintaining the reliability and effectiveness of the agent in production environments.

## 6. Security Best Practices

- Security risks, such as SQL injection, are mitigated by enforcing read-only database access and running the app within a secure environment.

## 7. Multi-Language Support

- The agent and LLM support multiple languages, offering an inclusive experience for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

## 8. Adaptability and Customization

- The workshop emphasizes the flexibility of the Foundry Agent Service, allowing you to adapt the agent for various use cases, such as customer support or competitive analysis, by modifying instructions and integrating additional tools.

This workshop equips you with the knowledge and tools to build and extend conversational agents tailored to your business needs, leveraging the full capabilities of the Foundry Agent Service.
